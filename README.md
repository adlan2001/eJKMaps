# eJKMaps

eJKMaps is a system that I developed during my time as an intern in [Jurukur Khoo & Mas](https://jurukurkhoomas.com.my) from July to October 2023. It is actually the idea of my supervisor, Sr Ts Mohamad Azuwan to have an integrated system that will store and display geospatial data gathered from the surveying projects done by the company.
